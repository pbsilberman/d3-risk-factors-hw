					<h1>Analysis of Risk Factors</h1>
					<p>Many of the findings from this dataset are somewhat rudimentary. For example, we can easily tell that there is a correlation between
						a lack of healthcare and median household income. This is totally unsurprising; if the median family has a higher income, they are more likely
						to have healthcare. Similarly, the correlation between poverty percentage and lack of healthcare reflects the same conclusion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps more interesting is the total lack of correlation between median age and any risk factors. 
						None of obesity, smoking percentage, nor lack of healthcare had any strong correlation with median age.
					</p>
					<p>
						The correlation between poverty and obesity is relatively small, but there does appear to be a correlation.
						Logically, this follows; those with a higher income can afford to eat healthier and are more likely to have time for 
						focusing on their physical health. The correlation between poverty and smoking is a bit more interesting. Smoking 
						is a particularly expensive habit in many states so the correlation there may have some deeper psychosomatic meaning that
						I do not have the ability to analyze.
